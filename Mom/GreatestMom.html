              You are the most giving person I know and I love you very much. I cannot imagine a world without you in it, and I mean, if you weren't in the world then I wouldn't be either :) You are very great at doing hair, you are a superb cook, you are a great writer, you are one of the funniest people ever, and the list of things that you could do in your life is endless, but you chose to be a teacher because of how compassionate you are and how much you want to help young people make the most out of their lives and that is why God is going to bless you. It may not be tonight and it may not be tomorrow, but when you least expect it, you are going to find yourself at a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow! I couldn't imagine anyone more worthy of praise and adoration than you besides maybe Dad and God of course ;) If I could, I would spend every minute of everyday just spending time with my family because that is how much you all mean to me and hearing you upset makes me want to manifest my own car right now and drive home just so I can hug you. I love you so very much and I want you to know that you are doing everything very well and try not to stress about it. I love you mom!
